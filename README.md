**🎣 Go Phish Simulation Lab**

This lab was designed to explore how phishing attacks work and how effective they can be, by simulating a real-world phishing campaign in a safe and ethical environment. Using Kali Linux and GoPhish, I created and launched a campaign targeting 21 of my close friends and family members to raise awareness.

**🛠️ The Setup**

✅ Built a phishing simulation using Kali Linux and GoPhish

✅ Spoofed a fake Zoom login page

✅ Created a landing page via Wix that said: "You’ve been phished" and included educational tips

✅ Sent the phishing email to 21 friends/family

**📊 The Results**

👉 7 people clicked and were surprised by how real the site looked

👉 Multiple people replied: “You got me!”

❗ Most emails went to spam, but enough landed to prove how easily phishing works

**💡 What I Learned**

The realism of phishing emails makes them dangerously effective even among tech-savvy users.

Most email providers still allow phishing emails through, despite spam filters.

Setting up a phishing campaign offers hands-on experience with tools like GoPhish, domain management, and educational mitigation techniques.

**⚠️ Disclaimer**

This simulation was conducted ethically and with consent from all participants. No sensitive data was collected, and all participants were educated immediately after the campaign. This project is strictly for educational and awareness purposes.
